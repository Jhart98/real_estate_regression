How is tax affected in real estate and by which features?

Data

Analysis:

Industry has a direct positive correlation with tax. <br>
There is also a postive correlation between the RAD number and the tax <br>
However other than those 2 features the others did not have much correlation <br>


Conclusion:

After running a basic linear regression the score was already at 90% on the test data<br>
Since it scored 87% on the training data, the model was not overfit.
